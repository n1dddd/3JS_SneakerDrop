## History(ish) of Jordan 1 Sneakers

This repository is home to the a small collection of iconic Jordan 1 sneaker colourways, and some of the stories and inspirations behind them. The collection is presented by way of React presented 3D models, using libraries fit for GLTF 3D model manipulation (threejs, react-three-fiber and react-three-drei.) The project uses a mix of tailwind and vanilla CSS.

This was a passion project, and also a push to learn something new. I saw many youtube videos that explored the use of 3D models in web development, and decided to dive into the documentation and the community. I used a light weight state management library to enable changes of the main gallery of shoes view to the individual shoe view. A challenge that I consistenly ran into was sizing for varying viewports. The 3D models are not dynamic, but on intial render the viewport is checked and the camera and FOV change accordingly.

I greatly enjoyed bringing the idea to life, and host the design [here!!!](https://threejs-jordan-history.vercel.app/)
